Currently dtkeden consists of a number of components

1) The eden machine
2) The tcl interface
3) dtkeden protocol support
4) The eden code (definitions)

By using %gel component 2 will be definable as a subset of component 4.
What would be nice is if the the networking could be definitive in a 
similar way.

I visualise a basic tkeden in which dtkeden would be defined by the following

%gel
... ## Augmented definitions to make tkeden look like the current dtkeden

%eden
installNetwork();

%network
... ## definitions about the current dtkeden protocol

%eden
... ## some code to trigger networking upon redefinition etc.


This would provide a very general tool. For example the following
would create a definitive web server:

%eden
installNetwork();

%network
... ## definitions about http protocol

%eden
... ## definitions triggered on the action within the defined protocol

Possible applications: instant message client, interface to cvs tree, ssh client.
