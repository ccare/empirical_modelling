The model can be run using the included bash script or
by loading the file into tkeden.

The model provides a 2-Dimensional representation of an
amsler planimeter. As the mouse moves, the end of one
of the arms move. On an actual planimeter, a wheel is 
attached to the edge of this arm. A two-dimensional
view of that wheel is provided in the top right of the
%scout screen. 

As the pointer of the planimeter is moved around the
wheel moves due to a combination of slipping and rolling.
The amount the wheel rolls corresponds to the area traced
by the pointer. This rotation is represented in the text 
window. The reset button resets this value to zero.
