This directory contains some relevant documentation.

1) report.pdf
	This is the text of my third year project. Part I is about planimeter 
	history, but the Part II relates to the modelling undertaken
	in this package. The reader should find a chapter dedicated 
	to each model.

	This report is missing a number of images due to their copyright status
	being dubious. If you're interested further please contact me for more
	details.

2) planimeterModels.pdf
	This is a thrown-together document designed as an idiots guide to 
	running two of the models in this package - oppikofer and wetli.
