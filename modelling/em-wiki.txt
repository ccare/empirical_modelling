Empirical Modelling (EM), spelt with capitials to denote a particular 
approach and to distinguish it from ''any'' [[modelling]] done 
[[empirically]], is a novel approach to computer-based modelling 
that developed from research initiated in the early [[1980s]] by 
Meurig Beynon of the Department of [[Computer Science]] at the 
[[University of Warwick]], [[England]].
Early research within the group lead to the development of a new 
[[language]] called Eden - an Evaluator for Definitive Notations. The 
first implementation of Eden was by Simon Yung in was in [[1983]] and 
a number of [[contributers]] have been leading the development of this 
tool ever since.

The approach of [[modelling]] offered by Empirical Modelling (or EM as 
it is often known) centres on the principles of Observation, 
Dependency and Agency. The importance of dependency has been 
particulary well researched with a number of software tools that 
exploit it as a native concept being developed.
