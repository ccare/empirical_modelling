This documentation refers to both the \%analog 
notation, and the basic engine that comes with it.

Together these two components comprise version 1.0 of the \%analog notation. Version 1.0 couldbe seen very much as an initial attempt at producing a tool to enable analogue modelling. It could be imagined that what is required is something more broad than simply a notationfor electronic analogue computers but this is certainly a start.

In its current state the models produced with this notation are unfortunately rather digital in certain behaviour. These issues will be identified and discussed in the `where from here' section.

The electronic analogue computer was a...

\subsection{Principle components}
An analogue computer consisted of a number of modules. Each module consisted of an operational amplifyer that could be used as either an integrator or a summer. Typically each module also contained two potentiometers.
